            <p>Cricket involves two main roles: batting and bowling. The team batting tries to score runs by hitting the ball delivered by the bowler and running between the wickets, while the bowling team attempts to dismiss the batsmen by getting them out in various ways, such as bowling them out, catching them, or running them out.</p>
